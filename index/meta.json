Our research identiﬁed three standard processes: two-radiologist consensus, AI and radiologist consensus, and decision referral. In this process, AI ﬁlters out true negatives and passes inconclusive or true positives to a radiologist for further assessment and potential callback. Our research showed us that decision referral was the most effective method for detecting breast cancer.

Now, as I become more ingrained in my studies and enter the workforce, I realize the impact artiﬁcial intelligence has on my academic and personal life. No longer is it just a silly chatbot; it is completely revolutionizing the way I exist and think in our modern society. As a freshman, I was initially a Computer Science and Neuroscience major. I collaborated with an engineering student on a literature review that would be presented at RISE, focusing on the effectiveness of breast cancer detection. Our research identiﬁed three standard processes: two-radiologist consensus, AI and radiologist consensus, and decision referral. In this process, AI ﬁlters out true negatives and passes inconclusive or true positives to a radiologist for further assessment and potential callback. Our research showed us that decision referral was the most effective method for detecting breast cancer. Not only was it more accurate at identifying false positives and true negatives, but it also had several positive implications. By reducing the number of callbacks, clinics can operate more efﬁciently. This saves time and money and makes healthcare more accessible, particularly for underserved communities where medical resources are few and far between.

So, if implemented responsibly, AI-assisted diagnosis could make breast cancer screening more precise, accessible, and equitable, ultimately improving patient outcomes on a global scale. But AI’s potential isn’t limited to healthcare. Recently, Google Research announced FireSat, a satellite system that uses AI to detect wildﬁres before they get out of control. Even on the East Coast, we’ve felt the effects of the recent California wildﬁres. Whether it’s the hazy skies, the air quality warnings, or the eerie orange sunsets, it's clear how far-reaching these disasters can be in our communities. Wildﬁres don’t just devastate the areas they burn through; their impact stretches across states, affecting public health, ecosystems, and even the economy. So, with climate change making wildﬁres more frequent and intense, AI-driven tools like this show how technology can step in not just to help us react to disasters but also to prevent them from escalating in the ﬁrst place. When history looks back, these are the issues and topics that will be seen to have the most impact on modern societies. So, I hope to continue exploring all this ﬁeld offers to make daily life easier and accessible for those in all socioeconomic situations. This future is daunting, so I need to grab it by its mechanical horns and lead it into a future that beneﬁts, not discriminates. ● Any experience working with AI technologies? While I don’t have direct experience developing AI models, I’ve worked with various AI tools in an academic and creative context. Because of this, I now have more insight into AI's capabilities and how different outputs can be based on the model. In addition, as part of a project for my Object-Oriented Design class, I programmed my own \"AI\" player for a simulated Battleship game. This allowed me to explore how \"AI\" is designed to make decisions and how to integrate them into a game system. ● How do you envision contributing your unique perspective to this ﬁeld? I enjoy focusing on the ethical and legal challenges of developing and deploying AI and understanding the technical aspects more. This desire mainly comes from my experience at AIDE (Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Data Ethics), a working group at the Ethics Institute dedicated to exploring the implications of algorithmic biases, AI transparency, and more. I was lucky this semester to work with other students of various degree backgrounds and Professors John Basl and Vance Ricks to provide feedback to Colorado State Lawmakers on their proposed Anti-Discrimination in AI Law (CADAI). I focused on analyzing the act’s deﬁnitions and how they could be updated through moral and ethical frameworks surrounding discrimination, aiming to make the law more comprehensive. For example, within the deﬁnition of AI discrimination, the act didn’t account for a monoculture of an algorithm across different companies, which can lead to new forms of bias, as discussed in this paper by Kathleen Creel.

While I don’t have direct experience developing AI models, I’ve worked with various AI tools in an academic and creative context. Because of this, I now have more insight into AI's capabilities and how different outputs can be based on the model. In addition, as part of a project for my Object-Oriented Design class, I programmed my own \"AI\" player for a simulated Battleship game. This allowed me to explore how \"AI\" is designed to make decisions and how to integrate them into a game system. ● How do you envision contributing your unique perspective to this ﬁeld? I enjoy focusing on the ethical and legal challenges of developing and deploying AI and understanding the technical aspects more. This desire mainly comes from my experience at AIDE (Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Data Ethics), a working group at the Ethics Institute dedicated to exploring the implications of algorithmic biases, AI transparency, and more. I was lucky this semester to work with other students of various degree backgrounds and Professors John Basl and Vance Ricks to provide feedback to Colorado State Lawmakers on their proposed Anti-Discrimination in AI Law (CADAI). I focused on analyzing the act’s deﬁnitions and how they could be updated through moral and ethical frameworks surrounding discrimination, aiming to make the law more comprehensive. For example, within the deﬁnition of AI discrimination, the act didn’t account for a monoculture of an algorithm across different companies, which can lead to new forms of bias, as discussed in this paper by Kathleen Creel. Overall, this experience helped me realize how important it is to understand the technology and the potential responsibilities developers and deployers have when ensuring that AI is ethical and transparent. It’s clear that the laws governing AI need to evolve alongside technology, and this experience illuminated my passion for helping ensure that these legal frameworks support innovation without compromising social values. So, I'm excited to keep researching how technology, law, and business interact, making sure that AI development and application stay morally and responsibly done.

    "text": "Hi everyone, my name is Ash and I just want to make a little intro to the video that I’ll be showing you very soon. Through this video I am showing you clips of our Bahay Kubo preparation, where is eboard is kind of setting out throughout the day from morning to night before the show and having our general members come in and perform and just get the set, get the lighting and all that stuff. It’s a lot of work and a lot of set design and a lot of things, but we put a lot of work and effort into it. But these clips are really important because throughout this video, I’ll be just sharing what Barkada means to me and why this club means so much to me and other people. Thank you! Community. Or, in Tagalog, Bayanihan. This word embodies the Filipino spirit of unity, collaboration, and selflessness. By sharing their time, skills, and love, my ancestors established deep roots that allowed future generations to thrive. This value runs in my bloodline, shaping how I approach life and relationships. I apply Bayanihan to my group of friends—my barkada. I ran for Media Specialist in my university’s Filipino student association, NU Barkada, in my sophomore year, and ever since then, it was my dream to give back to the people who imbued my life with that community spirit. Now that I am a junior, I truly realize that I am so fortunate to have been given so many outlets when my academic and professional conquests become overwhelming. Because I am a CS and math major, I feel as though I can be too wrapped up in finding the correct answers or perfect solutions to the problems I encounter. I focused so much of my time on my classes, GPA, and future that I didn’t live in the present. Being on this e-board has changed everything for me. Throughout these years, or these three years, I have strived to focus on the other aspects of my life I have neglected, whether that be through creative decision-making when designing merch and social media posts, creating or partaking in the various dances we organize for our performances, or just showing up to be social about anything and everything with alumni and new members alike. I have found fulfilling peace and unconditional love through this club. But, Barkada is more than a club though, for us, it’s a living, breathing entity that continuously evolves to welcome and uplift everyone with whom it comes in contact."

But these clips are really important because throughout this video, I’ll be just sharing what Barkada means to me and why this club means so much to me and other people. Thank you! Community. Or, in Tagalog, Bayanihan. This word embodies the Filipino spirit of unity, collaboration, and selflessness. By sharing their time, skills, and love, my ancestors established deep roots that allowed future generations to thrive. This value runs in my bloodline, shaping how I approach life and relationships. I apply Bayanihan to my group of friends—my barkada. I ran for Media Specialist in my university’s Filipino student association, NU Barkada, in my sophomore year, and ever since then, it was my dream to give back to the people who imbued my life with that community spirit. Now that I am a junior, I truly realize that I am so fortunate to have been given so many outlets when my academic and professional conquests become overwhelming. Because I am a CS and math major, I feel as though I can be too wrapped up in finding the correct answers or perfect solutions to the problems I encounter. I focused so much of my time on my classes, GPA, and future that I didn’t live in the present. Being on this e-board has changed everything for me. Throughout these years, or these three years, I have strived to focus on the other aspects of my life I have neglected, whether that be through creative decision-making when designing merch and social media posts, creating or partaking in the various dances we organize for our performances, or just showing up to be social about anything and everything with alumni and new members alike. I have found fulfilling peace and unconditional love through this club. But, Barkada is more than a club though, for us, it’s a living, breathing entity that continuously evolves to welcome and uplift everyone with whom it comes in contact. By hosting countless events, creating spaces for different interests, and pouring our hearts out, we hope that everyone feels at home. But for those on e-board, it's not just an extracurricular, it’s also practically a part-time job. And I don’t think we would have it any other way, because if it were any less commitment, we wouldn’t have the impact we have today. Everyone in the club works so hard to ensure the roots that were planted here in 1998 will last far beyond the four/five years each person is within this club. And while that work is endless, the fruit of our labor is the love shared in the spaces we curate. [What does Barkada mean to you?]\n[Nikka] Barkada, to me, as much as this sounds cliché, it literally means a group of friends."

The reason it’s my favorite memory was because I just remember gleaming and my face lighting up while I was performing on stage and while I was with like a new community that I called home. [Therese] My favorite memory from Barkada was BK last year where I joined one dance and it was tinikling and this year I’m running it back. [Cassy] Overall for me, definitely like my eboard year was definitely like an amazing memory. Specifically, like preparing for BK and like BK in itself. Like it was our 25th anniversary and I just think we did so many like awesome things that year. [If you could leave a message for your future self about your Barkada, what would it be?] [Siraj] Remember to like give back to the communities that gave to you."

    "text": "present. Being on this e-board has changed everything for me. Throughout these years, or these three years, I have strived to focus on the other aspects of my life I have neglected, whether that be through creative decision-making when designing merch and social media posts, creating or partaking in the various dances we organize for our performances, or just showing up to be social about anything and everything with alumni and new members alike. I have found fulfilling peace and unconditional love through this club. But, Barkada is more than a club though, for us, it’s a living, breathing entity that continuously evolves to welcome and uplift everyone with whom it comes in contact. By hosting countless events, creating spaces for different interests, and pouring our hearts out, we hope that everyone feels at home. But for those on e-board, it's not just an extracurricular, it’s also practically a part-time job. And I don’t think we would have it any other way, because if it were any less commitment, we wouldn’t have the impact we have today. Everyone in the club works so hard to ensure the roots that were planted here in 1998 will last far beyond the four/five years each person is within this club. And while that work is endless, the fruit of our labor is the love shared in the spaces we curate. [What does Barkada mean to you?] [Nikka] Barkada, to me, as much as this sounds cliché, it literally means a group of friends. But it truly has been a family and a home away from home. [Gabe] You know, when you give something your all and do it in the way that we do, combine that with the four of the most formative years of your life and everything that I was and everything that I am and everything that I will continue to be that is all thanks to Barkada.

    "text": "August 28, 2025  Dear Kanders Churchill Fellowship Committee, I am writing to enthusiastically recommend Ashley La Rotonda for the Kanders Churchill Fellowship. As the Director of the AI for Impact Co-op Program and Senior Fellow at the Burnes Center for Social Change, I have had the privilege of selecting Ashley as a Generative AI Product Development Fellow from an exceptionally competitive pool of over 400 applicants. Her selection speaks volumes about her promise in leveraging technology for social good, and I am confident she will make outstanding contributions through the Kanders Churchill Fellowship. Ashley possesses a rare combination of technical excellence and human-centered design thinking that sets her apart from her peers. With four prior co-ops and internships at organizations ranging from Google to DraftKings' Storm Flag game development studio, she brings both the technical sophistication of Big Tech and the creative agility of smaller innovative companies. What truly distinguishes Ashley is her empathetic approach to problem-solving and her ability to foster unity across disciplinary boundaries. While the challenges we tackle at the Burnes Center can be daunting, Ashley's cheerful disposition and belief in collaborative potential motivates those around her to unite in our shared mission. She breaks down silos between technical and non-technical stakeholders with remarkable ease, embodying the interdisciplinary approach we value so deeply. Her capacity to see people, not just data and statistics, enables her to create solutions that genuinely improve quality of life. She is tech-oriented, but always human-centered—a philosophy that aligns perfectly with the Churchill Fellowship's mission of developing leaders who can bridge divides and create meaningful change. In her upcoming role as Generative AI Product Developer at the Burnes Center, Ashley will complete an impactful AI project in direct collaboration with public sector partners. This experience—working with government officials and advisors, co-designing and delivering solutions that enhance government services—will deepen her ability to translate cutting-edge technology into tangible public benefit. Her proven track record of bridging technical complexity with stakeholder needs positions her perfectly to maximize this opportunity."

    "text": "well as how developers and deployers of AI systems inevitably shape what enforcement looks like in practice. To deepen this learning, I turned to papers such as Creel and Hellman's Algorithmic Leviathan alongside Fazelpour and Danks's Algorithmic Bias: Sense, Sources, and Solutions. For the first time, I felt truly empowered in my field: learning to navigate legal jargon, identify points of bias, and engage with both technical and philosophical approaches to fairness. This sense of duty led me to apply to the AI4Impact Co-op, where I will collaborate with public sector leaders to develop AI systems designed to improve people's lives. Here, I aim not only to display my technical expertise but also to translate it into language that policymakers and practitioners can act upon. Cases such as New York Times v. OpenAI make it clear that many decision-makers lack the technical grounding needed to regulate rapidly evolving technologies. Without considering feasibility, orders risk being unenforceable, and without technical input, policies risk being irrelevant. This motivates me to strike a balance between ambitious protection and practical implementation. Although my learning extends beyond the realm of algorithms and legal language, it should be rooted in cultural and social contexts. Having spent my entire life in the United States, broadening my worldview is essential to shaping policy for technologies that surpass national boundaries. The opportunity to study in the UK will also deepen my understanding of how more centralized regulation can contrast with the U.S.'s more fragmented policies, as the Office for Artificial Intelligence's White Paper was deeply inspiring to the work I am pursuing. Immersing myself in that policy context would open my world up, allowing me to gain a deeper understanding of how AI will impact the citizens of the globe. The Bennet School of Public Policy at the University of Cambridge is the ideal setting for this development. Their approach to the Policy Analysis Exercise mirrors my current work at the Burnes Center, where I collaborate in a team to design solutions for the public sector by meeting and discussing firsthand. At Cambridge, I would be able to scale this work to an international context, learning to balance technical insight with political feasibility. This global mindset will enable me to guide the creation of sustainable and explainable AI, from the private sector to international governments.
